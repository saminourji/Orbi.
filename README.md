# Orbi. : The Time Tracker Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that tracks the time spent on websites and categorizes them into three categories:
work, social, and media (entertainement). The inspiration for this project came from the Apple Watch activity rings,
which track daily activity and motivate users to stay active throughout the day.


## Usage
The extension runs in the background and track the time spent on websites. The user can view the tracked time and the website categories 
by clicking on the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
\\
The user cannot customize the website categories or add/remove at the moment, but this option will be implemented in in the near future.

## Project Details
This project was completed in 24 hours as part of the 2023 edition of nwHacks (nwPlus Hackathon). 
The main objective of the project was to create a simple and functional Chrome extension that would be useful for students.

The project was built using React and JavaScript and it was a fun and challenging way to learn more about Chrome extensions and website tracking.
